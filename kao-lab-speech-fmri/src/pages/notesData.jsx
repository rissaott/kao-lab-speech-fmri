        text: "hi kiel! HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYYYY. honestly coming into sep, i remember the first day at bid night i was terrified, asking you if it was okay that i didn't drink. from then to retreat to our coffee chat, despite our good conversations, i would have never expected you to become one of my closest friends/mentors in the org. but honestly that random second coffee chat in sprounge changed everything. i related to you more than anyone else EVER. since then, i appreciate how much time you spent talking to me during my lowest moments (you and carissa taking me to get ice cream when i was sad or calling me when i was crying after yikes!) and hyping me up during higher ones. you guys are genuinely some of my favorite people, and im so grateful you guys came into my life. TBH my peace and content rn literally is because of your advice. im so excited to hear about your study abroad life and also to hang out with you again! have the most amazing day in literal EUROPE and eat rly good food. (i saw you finally got beli, please be active on it)",

        text: "HAPPY BIRTHDAY KIEL MESSINGER!!! I remember when I first realized you existed because Melissa Chen wouldn't stop talking about you. I used to tease her endlessly, and honestly at this point in time, you weren't really anything more than a punchline of my frequent jokes. A few months later, I could match a face to your name but you still weren't anything more than some dude who talked about his ex a lot and who would lose to me every time in basketball HAHA. I truly didn't foresee our paths crossing and merging as they would ultimately prove to. Fast forward to now after we've drank beer in the streets of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Madrid. After our shared appreciation of sports youtube, TopGun and A Few Good Men at the legendary Jackson apartment. What I'm really trying to say is that I'm extremely grateful for all the memories we've shared over the years. But as it always is with friendships, it's not just the highs that stand out but also the lows that we've shared and supported one another through. I appreciate you for being a high-quality, empathetic human being who values principle and doing right by others. You're a very genuine person and I hope you can see and feel the warmth and goodwill you've earned yourself from people all around you. You're a loyal and dependable friend and honestly, I believe these are hard to come by. I consider myself lucky to have spent so much time with you in the last year. Have an amazing day and year ahead -- here's to less stress and overthinking across the board. I'll see you when you come back and we can tear it up at Mammoth again. Take it easy Messinger and don't go too hard out there.",

        text: "Just wanted to wish you a happy birthday. Know we haven’t talked in a while, but now’s the perfect time to remind you that I’m super happy I’ve met you. You’ve helped me grow so much throughout the time I’ve known you. I wouldn’t want anyone else as my big. You’ve always been there when I’ve needed you, and I’m confident you’re gonna be in my life till years to come. There are some people you meet to where you know they’ll be in your life indefinitely and you’re one of those individuals for me. One of my favorite parts about you is your amazing character, and your intelligent mannerisms that guide everything you do. Shot o clock soon my boy. Happy birthday buddy.",
