        text: "hi kiel! HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYYYY. honestly coming into sep, i remember the first day at bid night i was terrified, asking you if it was okay that i didn't drink. from then to retreat to our coffee chat, despite our good conversations, i would have never expected you to become one of my closest friends/mentors in the org. but honestly that random second coffee chat in sprounge changed everything. i related to you more than anyone else EVER. since then, i appreciate how much time you spent talking to me during my lowest moments (you and carissa taking me to get ice cream when i was sad or calling me when i was crying after yikes!) and hyping me up during higher ones. you guys are genuinely some of my favorite people, and im so grateful you guys came into my life. TBH my peace and content rn literally is because of your advice. im so excited to hear about your study abroad life and also to hang out with you again! have the most amazing day in literal EUROPE and eat rly good food. (i saw you finally got beli, please be active on it)",
